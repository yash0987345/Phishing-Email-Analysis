Phishing Indicators:

|         Indicator            |                             Details                                     |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Fake sender domain         | `careerbuildcompany.com` is not affiliated with LinkedIn.               |
|   Urgency bait               | Encourages immediate clicking by displaying "28 notifications".         |
|   See what's new" button     | Generic call-to-action button that could lead to phishing site.         |
|   No personalization         | No user's name shown — LinkedIn usually addresses users by name.        |
|   Brand misuse               | Uses LinkedIn logo without verified domain source.                      |
|   No footer or contact info  | Legitimate LinkedIn emails contain full legal and contact information.  |

Tools Used:
    - Hover check on links
    - Domain verification for sender
    - Visual formatting and brand check

Conclusion:
    - This email impersonates LinkedIn using psychological triggers (e.g., “new messages”, “profile views”) to attract clicks. Combined with a spoofed sender
      domain, this is clearly a phishing attempt. It should be reported and deleted.
