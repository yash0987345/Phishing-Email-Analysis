Phishing-Email-Analysis - 1

Objective:
      - To analyze a suspicious email pretending to be from Microsoft and identify phishing characteristics to raise cybersecurity awareness.

Email Overview:
       - Subject: Microsoft account password change
       - Sender Email: support@msupdate.net
       - Recipient: ethan@hooksecurity.co
       - Time: 4:09 PM
       - Platform Info (claimed): iOS, Safari browser, IP: 77.196.86.10

Phishing Indicators:

|       Indicator              |                           Details                                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|   Fake sender domain         | `msupdate.net` is not an official Microsoft domain.                     |
|   Urgent tone                | “Your account has been compromised” triggers fear.                      |
|   Suspicious links           | Links may lead to phishing websites (hovering needed to confirm).       |
|   Generic greeting           | No personal name used — just "Dear user".                               |
|   Unexpected recipient       | The email is directed to `ethan@hooksecurity.co`, not a Microsoft user. |
|   Minimal branding           | No Microsoft logo, legal footer, or verification info.                  |
|   Spoofing                   | Appears to be from "Support" — a common tactic to look legitimate.      |

Tools Used:
       - Link hover check (to inspect if real domain matches link text)
       - Domain lookup to verify sender
       - Manual visual inspection of email layout and language

Conclusion:
       - This email is a **phishing attempt**. It uses spoofed identity, scare tactics, and suspicious links to manipulate the user into acting quickly. Users should **not click** on any links and **report** it            to their IT/security team.

Additional Notes:
      - Always check the domain before trusting any email sender.
      - Avoid clicking links in suspicious emails — go directly to the website if needed.
